  As a Developer
  I want to show the details for a specific cookbook

  @show_cookbook
  Scenario: Show a cookbook
    Given I am an administrator
     When I fully upload a sandboxed cookbook named 'testcookbook_valid' versioned '0.1.0' with 'testcookbook_valid'
     Then I 'GET' the path '/cookbooks/testcookbook_valid/0.1.0'
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'cookbook_name' and match 'testcookbook_valid'
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'name' and match 'testcookbook_valid-0.1.0'
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'files' and match '^\[\]$' as json
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'root_files' and match '^\[.+\]$' as json
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'recipes' and match '^\[.+\]$' as json
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'metadata' and match '^\{.+\}$' as json
     Then the inflated response should respond to 'attributes' and match '^\[.+\]$' as json
